# The output FORMAT follows the SDK version rather than any flag or option:
# OpenWrt replaced opkg with apk, so a 24.10 SDK emits .ipk and a 25.12 SDK
# emits .apk from identical sources. One architecture serves every target
# because the package sets LUCI_PKGARCH:=all.
#
# Both are pinned to a release, matching the workflow. The bare x86_64 tag is
# the snapshot SDK, which does not ship the SDK inside the image and so
# downloads and extracts it on every run -- around six times the wall clock,
# for a moving target that makes a red build ambiguous.
ARCH_IPK=x86_64-24.10.0
ARCH_APK=x86_64-25.12.5

# Git Bash rewrites arguments that look like absolute Unix paths into Windows
# paths, which would turn the container-side /feed into something like
# C:/Program Files/Git/feed. Ignored on Linux and macOS.

usage: ./build.sh <command> [package...]

  ipk     build .ipk  (SDK $ARCH_IPK): $PACKAGES
  apk     build .apk  (SDK $ARCH_APK): $PACKAGES
  all     build both
  shell   interactive shell in the SDK container
  clean   remove $DISTDIR/

Naming packages builds only those:

  ./build.sh apk qwdtt              just the control script and service layer
  ./build.sh apk luci-app-qwdtt     just the page (and its translations)

Expect a modest saving, not a fast loop. Most of a local run is fixed SDK
setup -- feeds, defconfig and the toolchain -- which happens whatever is
being built. This is for checking that a package still assembles, not for
iterating. Iterate with 'go test' and 'go build' in client/, which take
seconds, and 'sh -n' on the shell scripts.

Output lands in $DISTDIR/<sdk>/bin/packages/*/$FEEDNAME/, one directory per
SDK so 'all' keeps both formats instead of the second wiping the first.
Requires Docker. The first run downloads the SDK image (~1 GB) and takes a
while; the packages themselves assemble in seconds.

The client binary is cross-compiled from client/ in this checkout before the
SDK runs, so a local edit is picked up with no commit, tag or hash to update
first. That needs a Go toolchain on the host.
